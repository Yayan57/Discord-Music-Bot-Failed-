# Discord-Music-Bot-Failed-
This is a discord music bot that I made that would take your playlist from youtube music (wanted to add spotify and apple music later), input the playlist data into a 3rd party youtube player and play the playlist in your discord voice call. 
It could do all of that but actually play the music in the vc, and I tried everything, I tried all the available 3rd party youtube APIs (youtube only has a data api but nothing to play the videos or audio through), I looked into other music apps APIs and tried making my own youtube web scrapper to get the audio and none of it worked, at least not for free.
So this is me throwing in the towel and moving on to a project that I can actually get to work, but I worked so much on it that I felt like I should put it up somewhere so all my work was not for nothing.
